# Contributing & Making changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
    * This is usually based off the master branch.
    * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.

    * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; ```git branch fix/master/my_contribution master``` then checkout the new branch with ```git checkout fix/master/my_contribution```. Please avoid working directly on the master branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

    * ```IsCommit message about your awesome code contribution.##only provide an issue number if you're PR is referencing an issue.```

* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

# Pull Requests

**When contributing (by the way you're awesome for that so thanks) please keep your commits small and targeted when you're prepared to file a Pull Request. We’d prefer not seeing Pull Requests that contain 20 commits in multiple spots. Keep it small and it will make things simpler and much cleaner in the long run.**
